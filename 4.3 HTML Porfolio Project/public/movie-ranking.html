    <h1>The best movies according to Neill</h1>

    <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Aliens</h3>

    <p>
      Building on the original film, "Alien", this film features better acting,
      better special effects, and more terrifying monsters.
    </p>
    <h3>Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</h3>

      This movie really captures the essence of the novels, leaving out the
      boring bits, and brings every young reader's imagination to life.
      Borrowing heavily from the Sam Bakshi animated film, it recreates the
      novel in stunning detail, with loveable characters and impeccable acting.
    </p>
    <h3>Akira</h3>

    <p>
      This mind bending anime introduced the potential of animation as a serious
      art form to the West. Capturing the drug-fueled, violent cyberpunk fever
      dreams of a generation, this story of teenage rebels fighting authority
      only to destroy and remake the world is an eye-popping feast for the
      senses and sensibilities.
