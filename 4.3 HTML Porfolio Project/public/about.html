    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h2>Current</h2>
    <p>
      I am an agile project management consultant in Tokyo, Japan. Currently I
      am studying web development and AI. I have worked in the project
      management space for 3 years. I have extensive experience with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Jira - Project task management and Agile development</li>
      <li>Confluence - Project documentation</li>
      <li>Trello - Task management for non-techincal teams</li>
      <li>Asana - Project management</li>
      <li>M-Files - document and records management and office automation</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Prior work</h2>
    <p>
      For 5 years I worked as an English and IT teacher in Machida, Kawasaki,
      and Yokohama. I have a passion for teaching language and helping my
      students achieve their goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      For 6 years I worked as a workflow consultant for a large American
      corporation. I helped companies improve their document and information
      processes using various technologies such as multifunction printers,
      high-speed scanners, document management systems, and workflow automation
      tools. I typically could make general business processes between 60% to
      90% faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      For 6 years I was a university instructor at the University of Alberta,
      Department of East Asian Studies. In addition to teaching Japanese
      language, I taught courses in Japanese sociolinguistics, Japanese pop
      culture, Japanese modern literature, and Asian history and culture. I
      performed research on Japanese paralinguistic features called
      <i>aizuchi</i> and developed a method for measuring them quantitatively.
    </p>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    I have a lot of hobbies and interests, but recently I have focused on 3 main
    areas:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Photography</b><br />
        I love taking photos of everything and everything. Currently I have an
        OM System OM-1 Four Thirds mirrorless camera with way too many lenses.
        Recently I've been getting into bird photography, but my main areas are
        macro, street, and architecture
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Cooking</b><br />
        If you can tell me what's in it, I can probably cook it. I have a pantry
        full of spices from around the world and I'm not afraid to use them. I
        love hosting dinner parties. My favorite foods to cook are Indian,
        Chinese, and Greek, but I'm getting into Mexican and Middle Eastern
        foods more and more.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Agile project management</b><br />
        I am not what you would call an Agile evangelist but I find a lot of
        value in its methods and mindset. I believe Agile methods can be applied
        in many different fields, especially research and education. If your
        child struggles in school, talk to me! I can show you some effective
        agile strategies to help them get back on track, with your support.
      </li>
    </ol>
