 <h1>The best movies according to Neill</h1>

 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Aliens</h3>
<p>Building on the original film, "Alien", this film features better acting, better special effects, and more terrifying monsters.
</p>
<h3>Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</h3>
<p>This movie really captures the essence of the novels, leaving out the boring bits, and brings every young reader's imagination to life. Borrowing heavily from the Sam Bakshi animated film, it recreates the novel in stunning detail, with loveable characters and impeccable acting.
</p>
<h3>Akira</h3>
<p>This mind bending anime introduced the potential of animation as a serious art form to the West. Capturing the drug-fueled, violent cyberpunk fever dreams of a generation, this story of teenage rebels fighting authority only to destroy and remake the world is an eye-popping feast for the senses and sensibilities.
